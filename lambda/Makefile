# Makefile for generating zip files for lambda functions and then copying them
# to S3 for deployment. This Makefile will NOT WORK unless you fill in the S3DEST
# and AWSARGS variables below. Once those parameters are established, simply type
# 'make' or 'gmake' (depending on your UNIX-like OS) and it will build. 
#
# Behaviour: 
# Creates a file named ._foo.whatever based on foo.whatever.Uploads foo.whatever to
# the S3 bucket. The ._ file is a hack to figure out whether the file has
# been modified since the last time we uploaded to s3.

# Override S3 destination by changing this variable or setting it in the
# environment
S3DEST?=[YOUR BUCKET HERE]

# Set these if, for example, you use profiles on the AWS command line
# or if your 'aws' executable is in a weird place.
AWSARGS=--region [YOUR REGION] --profile [YOUR PROFILE, or 'default', or remove this]
AWSCMD=aws
ZIPCMD=zip

# disable all implicit make rules
.SUFFIXES:

# if you define "._foo.zip" as a file on this line, then it will look for
# a folder called foo, copy the standard files into it, and then make foo.zip.
